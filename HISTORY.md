In addition, the default value of the `discriminator_decay` has been changed to a more optimal
value. Also some improvements to the tests were added.

### Issues closed

## v0.4.1 - 2021-03-30

This release exposes all the hyperparameters which the user may find useful for both `CTGAN`
and `TVAE`. Also `TVAE` can now be fitted on datasets that are shorter than the batch
size and drops the last batch only if the data size is not divisible by the batch size.

## v0.3.0 - 2020-12-18

In this release we add a new TVAE model which was presented in the original CTGAN paper.
It also exposes more hyperparameters and moves epochs and log_frequency from fit to the constructor.

A new verbose argument has been added to optionally disable unnecessary printing, and a new hyperparameter
called `discriminator_steps` has been added to CTGAN to control the number of optimization steps performed
in the discriminator for each generator epoch.

The code has also been reorganized and cleaned up for better readability and interpretability.

to date runtimes.
